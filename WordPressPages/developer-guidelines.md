RESILIENT SMART GARDEN DEVELOPER GUIDE
Version 0.1: 04/18/2018 by Smardens
======================================
=======
PROJECT
=======
The Resilient Smart Garden Project aims to build a user-friendly system to monitor crops and maximize irrigation performance,
combining principles in both efficiency and permaculture. Â 
&nbsp;
========
FEATURES
========
- Collecting plant data through embedded sensors(humidity, temperature, UV, moisture).
- Solar-powered Arduino and wireless sensors.
- Automatic watering system utilizing drip irrigation.
- Manually enter plant growth and harvest data.
&nbsp;
============
INSTALLATION
============
Hardware wiring and installation is detailed in the <a href="https://smardens.com/user-documentation/">User Documentation</a> under the Materials and Installation section.
	
Software:
 - <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a>
