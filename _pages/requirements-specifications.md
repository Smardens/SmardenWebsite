<h3 style="text-align: left;">Executive Summary</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">According to the United States Geological Survey, nearly 65 percent of the world’s freshwater withdrawals are used to irrigate 330 million acres of agricultural land in the United States. On a home scale, as much as 25,000 gallons of water is used to irrigate one personal garden yearly and as much as 50 percent of that water is lost due to wind, evaporation, and runoff caused by inefficient irrigation methods and systems. Although knowing that fresh water is a finite resource that is becoming scarce, the United States still uses more water per capita than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">In order to solve this problem, The Resilient Smart Garden Project aims to build a user-friendly system to monitor crops and maximize irrigation performance, combining principles in both efficiency and permaculture. Our automated system will collect data to help suggest methods to maximize the growth and yield while minimizing irrigation, time, and costs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">The developed system will utilize an Arduino board along with multiple sensors to read the humidity and water levels in the garden environment and log that data to a database. Automated efficiency checks will then create a watering plan to implement based on the layout of the garden and the specific plants within it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">In a drought-prone Southern California, being able to implement a system like this is pivotal for the conservation of one of our most vital resources, water. Users from all levels of gardening skill will be able to implement this system and successfully grow a wide variety of vegetables and crops while doing their part to conserve the most amount of water as possible while gardening.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Stakeholder Diagram</h3>
[caption id="attachment_72" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-72 size-large" title="StakeholderDiagram" src="https://caitlinr1.sgedu.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Stakeholder-Model-1024x528.png" alt="" width="1024" height="528" /> This stakeholder diagram depicts which groups take the most interest in our project. The primary stakeholders will be CSULB and the Project Owner, and we will work with Garden Owners, Systems Experts and Maintenance to produce our project. The domain experts consist of the computer science advisor, the electrical engineering advisor, the permaculture advisor, and the business strategies analyst. The maintenance team consist of both the system maintenance expert and the garden maintenance expert. The garden owners consist of the researcher, the recreational user, and the commercial user. The system experts consist of the embedded system expert, the database expert, and the application expert.[/caption]

<h3 style="text-align: left;">Goal Model</h3>
[caption id="attachment_85" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<img class="wp-image-85 size-large" title="GoalModel" src="https://caitlinr1.sgedu.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Goal-Model-1-1-1024x719.png" alt="" width="1024" height="719" /> This goal model depicts the necessary goals our system will be able to conquer. Our main aim is to create a gardening system that will allow fruits and vegetables to permaculture in a garden.[/caption]

<h3>System Vision</h3>
[caption id="attachment_237" align="aligncenter" width="924"]<img class="wp-image-237 size-large" title="SystemVision" src="https://caitlinr1.sgedu.site/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/System-Vision-1-924x1024.png" alt="System Vision" width="924" height="1024" /> This system vision models the general concept of the project. It visually outlines the process of the system and how the stakeholders interact with the system and other stakeholders. The system vision labels the roles of each object and the contributions of each stakeholder. It also depicts the concerns of the stakeholder.[/caption]
