            <li>Mix 1-½ cups of 5-10-10 fertilizer per 25 feet of row into the top 3 to 4 inches of soil.</li>
            <li>Plant the seeds ¼ to ½ inch deep into well-drained, light soil.</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks, thin the seedlings so that they are spaced 8 to 12 inches apart.</li></ul></th>

   <tr>
    <th>Lettuce</th>
    <th><ul><li>Direct sowing is recommended as soon as the ground can be worked. Plant seeds ½ inch deep. Snow won’t hurt them, but a desiccating cold wind will.</li>
            <li>If you want an earlier crop, however, you may start seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks before last spring frost date for an earlier crop. Harden off seedlings for about one week, and transplant outside between 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after last spring frost.</li>
            <li>Seed may be sown in single rows or broadcast for wide row planting. When broadcasting, you’ll need to “thin” for the proper spacing.</li>
            <li>Your rows of plants should be 12 to 15 inches across.</li>
            <li>Cover the seeds with ¼ to ½ inch of soil.</li>
            <li>Water thoroughly at time of transplant.</li></ul>

            <li>Plant additional seeds every 3 weeks or so for multiple harvests. </li>
            <li>Plant carrot seeds 3 to 4 inches apart in rows. Rows should be at least a foot apart.</li>
            <li>Carrots are slow to germinate. They may take 3 or more weeks to show any signs of life, so don’t panic if your carrots don’t appear right away!</li>
            <li>Keep the soil moist, not wet, but don’t let it dry out, either.</li>
            <li>Carrots are best grown in full sunlight, but can tolerate a moderate amount of shade.</li></ul></th>
