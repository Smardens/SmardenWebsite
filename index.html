    <p>Our world has a finite amount of resources that are being depleted daily and without preemptive action, we will fail to sustain these resources for future generations. Freshwater is one of these finite resources that is becoming scarce, yet the United States still uses more water per capita than anywhere else in the world. According to the United States Geological Survey, nearly 65 percent of the world’s freshwater withdrawals are used to irrigate 330 million acres of agricultural land in the United States. On a home scale, as much as 25,000 gallons of water is used to irrigate one personal garden yearly and as much as 50 percent of that water is lost due to wind, evaporation, and runoff caused by inefficient irrigation methods and systems. In order to maintain sustainable usage, Smardens is at the forefront of this solution by marrying technology and environmental sustainability.</p>
    <p>In order to address this issue, The Resilient Smart Garden Project aims to build a user-friendly system to monitor crops and maximize irrigation performance, combining principles in both efficiency and permaculture.  Our automated watering system will collect data to help suggest methods to maximize the growth and yield while minimizing irrigation, time, and costs. It consists of small and light-weight hardware that is powered by solar energy and uses drip irrigation methods. The developed system will utilize an Arduino board along with multiple sensors to read the water levels in the garden environment and log that data to a database. The amount of watering depends on the humidity in the soil along with the amount of light and the temperature of the environment. Automated efficiency checks will then suggest watering schedules based on the layout of the garden and the specific plants within it.</p>
    <p>The versatile system is accessible through our energy efficient website. It contains an overview of the functionality and usability of the project as well as a secure portal to access the customizable watering plan to cater to different species of crops. In a drought-prone Southern California, being able to implement a system like this is pivotal for the conservation of one of our most vital resources, water. Users from all levels of gardening skill will be able to implement this system and successfully grow a wide variety of vegetation and crops while doing their part to conserve the most amount of water as possible while gardening.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:left;">Abstract</h3>
    <p>This is the Design Specification document for the Resilient Smart Garden Project, being developed by Caitlin Rubia, Brian Powell, and Xinyi Chen. The aim of this document is to structure the architecture and elaborate on the design constraints of the garden system.</p>
    <p>This document contains six diagrams- Architecture Overview Diagram, Entity Relationship Diagram, Activity Diagram, Message Sequence Chart, State Diagram, Class Diagram, to give a top-down view of our system. The document also includes a Site Map and a User Interface Mockups to further detail the specifications of our garden.</p>
    <p>Each of our diagrams was constructed with our stakeholders in mind, using the stakeholder matrix from our Requirement Specifications Document. We feel that we have executed the design of this system so that implementation will be efficient and effective in promoting permaculture in any garden.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;"> Architecture Overview Diagram</h3>
    <img src="image/ArchitectureOverview.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Architecture Overview Diagram"/> 
    <p>This architecture overview diagram shows the user of the system will be the normal user and the maintenance expert. The system will be using sensors, Arduino board, solar panels, Wi-Fi module and automatic watering function. The system will use crop nutrient database as support system.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;">Entity Relationship Diagram</h3>
    <img src="image/ERDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Entity Relationship Diagram" /> 
    <p>This entity relationship diagram depicts the interactions between all our objects. All objects are strong entities and are represented as green boxes. Weak attributes are represented by double circles, while strong attributes are a single circle. There is only one weak relationship, which is between the Maintenance Expert and the Garden. All other relationships are strong and have recorded data associated to the relationship.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;">Activity Diagram</h3>
    <img src="image/ActivityDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Activity Diagram" /> 
    <p>This is an activity diagram which shows how our system flows. At first the user will login to their portal and having option to choose between enter new crop data, enter specific environment data, watering schedule, enter crop growth data, sensor self-check, show tips and exit the program. Each input and edit the user makes will be updated in the database. The program will only exit when the user chooses to.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;">Message Sequence Chart</h3>
    <img src="image/MessageSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Message Sequence Chart" /> 
    <p>This message sequence chart illustrates the flow of interaction between each object. It also shows the action that is being done and the data that should be returned. Within the database if an item is requested the information is retrieved and sent back to the controller. The user will be controlling the controller to keep track of the garden system.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;">State Diagram</h3>
    <img src="image/StateDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="State Diagram" /> 
    <p>This is a state diagram for our system. Most of our system is automated and what states it does switch into will be based off of user input. The default state of the system will be waiting for a user decision, from there, based off user input, it can either be used to checks sensors or create/update watering plans. Users will be able to check sensors while an automated watering plan is underway. Once a watering plan is created/updated the watering state will happen automatically.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;">Class Diagram</h3>
    <img src="image/ClassDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Class Diagram" /> 
    <p>This is a class diagram for our system. We will have a user class which uses the garden. We will also have a maintenance expert that maintains both the garden and the embedded system. The garden will contain the plant and the embedded system. The embedded system will keep tracks of solar panel, pump, sensor, sprinkler and Arduino board.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;">Site Map</h3>
    <img src="image/sitemap.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Site Map" /> 
    <p>This site map is the overview of our website. It shows the sections in orange, while the web pages are in blue. It also shows how the key areas of the pages relate to our project and its process. Because it is a top to down view of the website, the Home Page, Smarden: The Resilient Smart Garden, is at the top while the Portal Page, My Garden Portal is at the bottom because only users are able to access information within the portal.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:left;">Technologies Diagram</h3>
    <img src="image/Technologies.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Technologies Diagram" /> 
    <p>This technologies diagram shows the interaction between all technologies used. The hardware that will be placed in the garden to receive data from the sensors is the Arduino Due, using the Arduino platform. It sends the information to the database, which will be the MongoDB platform. Then the information in the database is sent to the server, which will be the Site Ground platform.</p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    The Resilient Smart Garden Project aims to build a user-friendly system to monitor crops and maximize irrigation performance, combining principles in both efficiency and permaculture.
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    The Resilient Smart Garden Project, powered by <g class="gr_ gr_162 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" data-gr-id="162" id="162">Smardens</g>, is an attempt to promote permaculture and efficiency through the use of drip irrigation and solar energy. This project is designed to be flexible and scalable with the hopes of being able to be implemented in any garden. Following this guide will help you install a system of your own to monitor and irrigate your garden. We, here at <g class="gr_ gr_170 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" data-gr-id="170" id="170">Smardens</g>, thank you for being earth-conscious and environmentally responsible.
    
    <h2>Materials &amp; Installation</h2>
    
    <p>The Resilient Smart Garden project utilizes all of the components below:</p>
    
    <p><u>Required Hardware: </u></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Arduino Due</li>
      <li>Moisture Sensor</li>
      <li>UV Sensor</li>
      <li>Temperature and Humidity Sensor</li>
      <li>Water solenoid valve</li>
      <li>WiFi module</li>
      <li>Solar panels</li>
      <li>Transistors</li>
      <li>Resistors</li>
      <li>Diodes</li>
      <li>Capacitors</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><u>Hardware Installation </u></p>
    
    <p>The placement of each individual system in your garden should be structured in a way to maximize humidity readings for the plants in your environment. Below are diagrams depicting the optimal placement of each humidity sensor in various garden layouts.</p>
    
    <p>For larger garden plots, a humidity sensor should be located in the middle of at least four(4) plants. While the location of the Due does not matter, the light and temperature sensors should be located where the garden receives the most sunlight.</p>
    
    <p>In smaller garden plots, a humidity sensor is most effective between two plants. While the location of the Due does not matter, the light and temperature sensors should be located where the garden receives the most sunlight.</p>

    RESILIENT SMART GARDEN DEVELOPER GUIDE
    Version 0.1: 12/04/2018 by Smardens
    ======================================
    =======
    PROJECT
    =======
    The Resilient Smart Garden Project aims to build a user-friendly system to monitor crops and maximize irrigation performance,
    combining principles in both efficiency and permaculture.  

    ========
    FEATURES
    ========
    - Collecting plant data through embedded sensors(humidity, temperature, UV, moisture).
    - Solar-powered Arduino and wireless sensors.
    - Automatic watering system utilizing drip irrigation.
    - Manually enter plant growth and harvest data.

    ========
    GETTING STARTED
    ========
    To compile and test our Smart Garden solution you will need the software below. With the required software installed you will 
    also need to following settings inside the Arduino IDE. Our solution is split into two parts. The first is the Arduino Due Main 
    code which has several different functions: store all sensor data on an SD card from the ESP webserver connected to its serial port, 
    deciding if it's time to water based on soil mositure levels, and powering all the devices connected to it(SD card, ESP webserver, 
    water solenoid valve). The second are the AP_Start and AP_Connect sketches which handle sending and receiving the sensor data from 
    the garden sensors at specific intervals. The AP_Connect is altered for each specific sensor in the garden. 
    
    There are wiring diagrams located in the Diagrams folder which detail the embedded system layout. 

    ========
    REQUIRED SOFTWARE
    ========
    - <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a>
