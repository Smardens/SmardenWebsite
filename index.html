      <p>Our world has a finite amount of resources that are being depleted daily and without preemptive action, we
        will fail to sustain these resources for future generations. Freshwater is one of these finite resources that
        is becoming scarce, yet the United States still uses more water per capita than anywhere else in the world.
        According to the United States Geological Survey, nearly 65 percent of the world’s freshwater withdrawals are
        used to irrigate 330 million acres of agricultural land in the United States. On a home scale, as much as
        25,000 gallons of water is used to irrigate one personal garden yearly and as much as 50 percent of that water
        is lost due to wind, evaporation, and runoff caused by inefficient irrigation methods and systems. In order to
        maintain sustainable usage, Smardens is at the forefront of this solution by marrying technology and
        environmental sustainability.</p>
      <p>In order to address this issue, The Resilient Smart Garden Project aims to build a user-friendly system to
        monitor crops and maximize irrigation performance, combining principles in both efficiency and permaculture.
         Our automated watering system will collect data to help suggest methods to maximize the growth and yield while
        minimizing irrigation, time, and costs. It consists of small and light-weight hardware that is powered by solar
        energy and uses drip irrigation methods. The developed system will utilize an Arduino board along with multiple
        sensors to read the water levels in the garden environment and log that data to a database. The amount of
        watering depends on the humidity in the soil along with the amount of light and the temperature of the
        environment. Automated efficiency checks will then suggest watering schedules based on the layout of the garden
        and the specific plants within it.</p>
      <p>The versatile system is accessible through our energy efficient website. It contains an overview of the
        functionality and usability of the project as well as a secure portal to access the customizable watering plan
        to cater to different species of crops. In a drought-prone Southern California, being able to implement a
        system like this is pivotal for the conservation of one of our most vital resources, water. Users from all
        levels of gardening skill will be able to implement this system and successfully grow a wide variety of
        vegetation and crops while doing their part to conserve the most amount of water as possible while gardening.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;">Abstract</h3>
      <p>This is the Design Specification document for the Resilient Smart Garden Project, being developed by Caitlin
        Rubia, Brian Powell, and Xinyi Chen. The aim of this document is to structure the architecture and elaborate on
        the design constraints of the garden system.</p>
      <p>This document contains six diagrams- Architecture Overview Diagram, Entity Relationship Diagram, Activity
        Diagram, Message Sequence Chart, State Diagram, Class Diagram, to give a top-down view of our system. The
        document also includes a Site Map and a User Interface Mockups to further detail the specifications of our
        garden.</p>
      <p>Each of our diagrams was constructed with our stakeholders in mind, using the stakeholder matrix from our
        Requirement Specifications Document. We feel that we have executed the design of this system so that
        implementation will be efficient and effective in promoting permaculture in any garden.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;"> Architecture Overview Diagram</h3>
      <img src="image/ArchitectureOverview.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Architecture Overview Diagram" />
      <p>This architecture overview diagram shows the user of the system will be the normal user and the maintenance
        expert. The system will be using sensors, Arduino board, solar panels, Wi-Fi module and automatic watering
        function. The system will use crop nutrient database as support system.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;">Entity Relationship Diagram</h3>
      <img src="image/ERDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Entity Relationship Diagram" />
      <p>This entity relationship diagram depicts the interactions between all our objects. All objects are strong
        entities and are represented as green boxes. Weak attributes are represented by double circles, while strong
        attributes are a single circle. There is only one weak relationship, which is between the Maintenance Expert
        and the Garden. All other relationships are strong and have recorded data associated to the relationship.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;">Activity Diagram</h3>
      <img src="image/ActivityDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Activity Diagram" />
      <p>This is an activity diagram which shows how our system flows. At first the user will login to their portal and
        having option to choose between enter new crop data, enter specific environment data, watering schedule, enter
        crop growth data, sensor self-check, show tips and exit the program. Each input and edit the user makes will be
        updated in the database. The program will only exit when the user chooses to.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;">Message Sequence Chart</h3>
      <img src="image/MessageSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Message Sequence Chart" />
      <p>This message sequence chart illustrates the flow of interaction between each object. It also shows the action
        that is being done and the data that should be returned. Within the database if an item is requested the
        information is retrieved and sent back to the controller. The user will be controlling the controller to keep
        track of the garden system.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;">State Diagram</h3>
      <img src="image/StateDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="State Diagram" />
      <p>This is a state diagram for our system. Most of our system is automated and what states it does switch into
        will be based off of user input. The default state of the system will be waiting for a user decision, from
        there, based off user input, it can either be used to checks sensors or create/update watering plans. Users
        will be able to check sensors while an automated watering plan is underway. Once a watering plan is
        created/updated the watering state will happen automatically.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;">Class Diagram</h3>
      <img src="image/ClassDiagram.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Class Diagram" />
      <p>This is a class diagram for our system. We will have a user class which uses the garden. We will also have a
        maintenance expert that maintains both the garden and the embedded system. The garden will contain the plant
        and the embedded system. The embedded system will keep tracks of solar panel, pump, sensor, sprinkler and
        Arduino board.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;">Site Map</h3>
      <img src="image/sitemap.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Site Map" />
      <p>This site map is the overview of our website. It shows the sections in orange, while the web pages are in
        blue. It also shows how the key areas of the pages relate to our project and its process. Because it is a top
        to down view of the website, the Home Page, Smarden: The Resilient Smart Garden, is at the top while the Portal
        Page, My Garden Portal is at the bottom because only users are able to access information within the portal.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:left;">Technologies Diagram</h3>
      <img src="image/Technologies.png" style="width:60%" onclick="whiteClick(this)" alt="Technologies Diagram" />
      <p>This technologies diagram shows the interaction between all technologies used. The hardware that will be
        placed in the garden to receive data from the sensors is the Arduino Due, using the Arduino platform. It sends
        the information to the database, which will be the MongoDB platform. Then the information in the database is
        sent to the server, which will be the Site Ground platform.</p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      The Resilient Smart Garden Project aims to build a user-friendly system to monitor crops and maximize irrigation
      performance, combining principles in both efficiency and permaculture.

      <h2>Description</h2>
      The Resilient Smart Garden Project, powered by <g class="gr_ gr_162 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace"
        data-gr-id="162" id="162">Smardens</g>, is an attempt to promote permaculture and efficiency through the use of
      drip irrigation and solar energy. This project is designed to be flexible and scalable with the hopes of being
      able to be implemented in any garden. Following this guide will help you install a system of your own to monitor
      and irrigate your garden. We, here at <g class="gr_ gr_170 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace"
        data-gr-id="170" id="170">Smardens</g>, thank you for being earth-conscious and environmentally responsible.

      <h2>Materials & Installation</h2>

      <p>The Resilient Smart Garden project utilizes all of the components below:</p>

      <p><u>Required Hardware: </u></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Arduino Due</li>
        <li>Moisture Sensor</li>
        <li>UV Sensor</li>
        <li>Temperature and Humidity Sensor</li>
        <li>Water solenoid valve</li>
        <li>WiFi module</li>
        <li>Solar panels</li>
        <li>Transistors</li>
        <li>Resistors</li>
        <li>Diodes</li>
        <li>Capacitors</li>
      </ul>

      <p><u>Hardware Installation </u></p>

      <p>The placement of each individual system in your garden should be structured in a way to maximize humidity
        readings for the plants in your environment. Below are diagrams depicting the optimal placement of each
        humidity sensor in various garden layouts.</p>

      <p>For larger garden plots, a humidity sensor should be located in the middle of at least four(4) plants. While
        the location of the Due does not matter, the light and temperature sensors should be located where the garden
        receives the most sunlight.</p>

      <p>In smaller garden plots, a humidity sensor is most effective between two plants. While the location of the Due
        does not matter, the light and temperature sensors should be located where the garden receives the most
        sunlight.</p>

      <h2>Online Portal Registration</h2>

      <p>To begin, please register an account in <a href="login.php">portal website</a>.</p>

      <p>The online portal will give you a multitude of options when signed in. You will be given a brief introduction
        on the agricultural issue&nbsp;and you will be able to take a quiz about the issue and our system. By clicking
        <strong>MyGarden </strong>tab, you will be able to enter the crop information (what type of crop did you plant,
        how much did you plant, how many pound did you harvest.). You can also check the data that was collected by the
        sensors in your garden by clicking <strong>Graphs </strong>tab.&nbsp;If you wish to test your sensors,
        the&nbsp;<strong>Sensor </strong>tab&nbsp;will automatically check all sensors and tell you if you need to go
        out and check your sensors.</p>

      <h3 id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
      <p>To compile and test our Smart Garden solution you will need the software below. With the required software
        installed you will also need to following settings inside the Arduino IDE. Our solution is split into two
        parts. The first is the Arduino Due Main code which has several different functions: store all sensor data on
        an SD card from the ESP webserver connected to its serial port, deciding if it's time to water based on soil
        mositure levels, and powering all the devices connected to it(SD card, ESP webserver, water solenoid valve).
        The second are the AP_Start and AP_Connect sketches which handle sending and receiving the sensor data from
        the garden sensors at specific intervals. The AP_Connect is altered for each specific sensor in the garden.</p>
      <p>There are wiring diagrams located in the Diagrams folder which detail the embedded system layout.</p>
